Notes:

1. Goal: Create a modal in Salesforce that displays Opportunity details and allows sending the Account ID to a webhook.

2. Components created so far:
   a. Visualforce Page: Named "Contract_Details" to display Opportunity information.
   b. Apex Controller: "OpportunityDetailController" to handle data retrieval and webhook sending.
   c. Test Class: "OpportunityDetailControllerTest" for code coverage.

3. Webhook URL: https://n8n.skoop.digital/webhook/2a5e55ae-1be9-466c-8f9a-a6a7391d305e

4. Current Issues:
   a. Deployment failures due to insufficient test coverage (0% instead of required 75%).
   b. Possible file naming mismatches between class names and file names.
   c. Potential issues with project structure or Salesforce CLI configuration.

5. Attempted Solutions:
   a. Created a test class to improve code coverage.
   b. Updated the Apex controller to be more testable.
   c. Tried various Salesforce CLI commands to deploy the components.

6. Next Steps/Options:
   a. Verify file names match class names exactly (e.g., OpportunityDetailController.cls).
   b. Ensure all files are in the correct directories within the project structure.
   c. Check the sfdx-project.json file for correct configuration.
   d. Try deploying components individually to isolate issues.
   e. Validate the Salesforce CLI installation and authentication to the org.
   f. Consider creating a new Salesforce project from scratch and moving the files over.

7. Key Components to Focus On:
   a. Visualforce Page (Contract_Details.page)
   b. Apex Controller (OpportunityDetailController.cls)
   c. Test Class (OpportunityDetailControllerTest.cls)
   d. Project structure and configuration files

8. Deployment Command Being Used:
   sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app

To move forward, it's crucial to ensure all components are correctly named, placed in the right directories, and that the test class provides adequate coverage. Additionally, verifying the Salesforce CLI setup and project configuration may help resolve the deployment issues.

Deployment Process and Issues:

1. The team is using Salesforce CLI (sf command) for deployment:
   - Command: sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app
   - This attempts to deploy all components in the force-app directory

2. Deployment failures are occurring with the following error:
   "Average test coverage across all Apex Classes and Triggers is 0%, at least 75% test coverage is required."

3. The deployment process is not running any tests (0 passing, 0 failing, 0 total)

4. Earlier attempts showed a file name mismatch error:
   "File name mismatch with class name: OpportunityDetailController"

5. The team has tried various troubleshooting steps:
   - Resetting source tracking: sf project reset tracking --path force-app (command not recognized)
   - Deploying with ignore conflicts: sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app --ignore-conflicts
   - Running local tests: sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app --test-level RunLocalTests

Project Structure and Configuration:

1. The project appears to be a Salesforce DX project with the following structure:
   - force-app/main/default/classes/ (for Apex classes)
   - force-app/main/default/pages/ (for Visualforce pages)

2. Key files in the project:
   - OpportunityDetailController.cls
   - OpportunityDetailControllerTest.cls
   - Contract_Details.page

3. The sfdx-project.json file should be present in the root directory, but its contents haven't been verified

Salesforce CLI and Authentication:

1. The team is using Salesforce CLI version 2.57.7 (sf --version output provided)

2. They've authenticated to the org:
   - Org alias: josh-t7x1@force.com
   - Command used: sf config set target-org josh-t7x1@force.com --global

3. The org appears to be a production org (based on login URL)

Other Important Points:

1. The team initially had issues with sfdx-cli installation and switched to @salesforce/cli

2. There were problems with creating Apex classes directly in the org:
   "Can not create Apex Class on an active organization" error in Developer Console

3. The team is trying to implement a modal that shows Opportunity details and sends only the Account ID to a webhook

4. The webhook URL is provided and can accept any inputs

5. The Visualforce page (Contract_Details) uses Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) for styling

6. The Apex controller (OpportunityDetailController) handles both displaying Opportunity details and sending the Account ID to the webhook

7. A test class (OpportunityDetailControllerTest) was created to improve code coverage, but it doesn't seem to be running during deployment

To move forward, the team needs to:
- Verify all file names match their corresponding class names
- Ensure the project structure is correct
- Check the sfdx-project.json file for proper configuration
- Investigate why tests aren't running during deployment
- Consider using more specific deployment commands to isolate issues
- Verify Salesforce CLI installation and authentication
- Potentially create a new project and migrate files if issues persist
